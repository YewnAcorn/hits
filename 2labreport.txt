I think the idea is basically to use our understanding
of the concepts in the book to build a 10 armed bandit
and build a player that can estimate the means of the
different arms. There is a framework on github which I
will look at for clues if I get stuck, but I really
enjoy learning by trying to build it from just what
I understand. That way if I dont understand something
I can't skip it.

so starting out I'll just build the bandit because
thats simple enough. Like a function and you can
put in as an arguement what lever you'd like to
pull and it will put out a random number as your
reward. That will have a secret mean which is high
or low. 

So I built that machine and then I made an agent class
that keeps track of is things and has methods for making
a choice and playing the game and updating its fields
but it wasn't working for a while and then I found two
errors that were slowing me down was: 1 needing a new random seed
and 2 making sure the step size was proportional to the number of moves
in the temporal difference calculation

I got it working now and I'll post my code to the
github class room if I can figure that out. If not
it will also be in my own github
