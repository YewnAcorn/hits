announcements:
  submissions are open on canvas
  in modules for each week should be submitted
  in .pdf or plaintext
  no office hours this week, instead come to class early or stay late
  
hacker mentality:
  open-endedness can be jarring at first
  it is normal for things to be open-ended
    take good notes, ask the right questions
    dont get stuck on a red herring
    talk to your peers. It is a more social
    endeavor than main programming

if you are ahead on your homework you
can work on other things:
 CSRF
 DOM-Based vulnerabilites
 Deserialization
 JWT attacks
 w3challs.com web category & identifying unknown vulnerabilies in web security academy
**these last ones are more difficult**
(need to be able to identify unknown vulnerabilities) 

went over some questions from lab2
what is meant by "escaping shell metacharacters" is
that basically a whitelist is a better strategy to defend
than a blacklist because there are too many combinations
of characters

went over second to last lab and if it really needs
the collaborator. The lab can be successful by triggering
the lookup without needing burpsuite collaborator.
Also, it is possible to set up your own DNS server
and monitor the traffic on your own.

question about the DNS lookup and exfiltration
it doesn't have to be DNS in real life it can
be any outside server.

SQL Basics:
Server Querey Language

SQL is for querying databases. The databses can
hold anything, files, pictures, executables, password hashes, login username password pairs

for example 
	a client can send a server

	app.com/login?user=myuser&password=mypass

	a username and passwrod with a GET request
	and then the server hashes the password and
	then compares the hash to the hashed password

	SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='myuser'
	AND password='adfsadfsad2#$@ASDq34' 

SQL injection description:

happens when when app doesnt sanitize user provided input
techniques include using SQL tokens such as booleans
wildcards, commends, logical AND/OR and URL/Hex encoded
versions of the above tokens

not all SQL injections use the same syntax

for example

	app.com/login?user=admin'OR1=1--&password=mypass

	which makes

	SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin'OR1=1--AND password='adfsadfsad2#$@ASDq34' 

	in someversions of sql -- starts a comment

        This gives every row in the table

Bounty payouts for SQL injection can be very high
although this bug is increasingly heard to find in the
wild $500-$4k

it still happens every now and then but not any more
