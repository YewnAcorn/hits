2 week lab report


This week we did labs on file traversal and
OS command injection. These were labs on the
burp academy site. Doing these labs I learned
about exploiting vulnerabilities in directory
traversal and os injection. I also learned how
to use a few of the features on burp suite.

I also learned about how to use the network
tab on the inspector tool on firefox to copy
a curl command and use that to manually get 
the data or how to use the 'edit and resend'
option as well
