			computer uses to access your network. This will give your
			VM an address on your local network.
		Start up the machine, it will install.
		username and password: gameadmin
		once you are logged in do the command ip addr to see your
			VMs assigned IP addess on your local network
		Back on your host machine open a terminal and run the command
			ssh gameadmin@yourIPaddressHere
	You can now do the warzone labs
		Each lab will have a different username to login. The information
			we will need is all in the README	
		It contains lectures as well which are part of the reading for the labs
	
	Reminder to get your copy of 'Hacking the Art of Exlpoitation'
		It also has a VM that can be used to follow along with examples from the reading
		You can find it on the book's website
		google: 'Hacking the Art of Exploitation book src'
		copy and paste the download link to the browser and it will download it
		That can be uploaded to the VM we made at the beginning of the quarter
			using SFTP or SCP to be unarchived and then used to learn
