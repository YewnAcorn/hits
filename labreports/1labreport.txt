1 week lab report

This week we started by going over the basics
of how flask can serve up html pages and interact
with a database. The stuff we will be doing in the
future is based on knowing some of this stuff

I actually did this lab about 3 or 4 times because
when I would come back my virtual machine would be
frozen and when I restarted it all my work was done

but eventually I got the whole thing going. I was
glad to learn about template inheritance. I am making
some flask websites for fun in my free time but I didnt
know about html inheritance and now that I do I have saved
a lot of time
