What are the 4 main components of a reinforcement learning system?

make sense of the environment, be able to take actions to change
environment, have a goal related to the environment. (sensation, action,
goal) 
but that's only three, so there must be some other 4 main components, I'll
keep reading.

the four main elements of reinforcement learning are:
a policy,
a reward signal,
a value function, 
a model of the environment (optional)


What is the difference between evolutionary learning and reinforcement learning?

it sounds like evolutionary learning creates non-learning agents that
carry out policies and then makes decisions based on the results of
observing the results of that
whereas reinforcement learning is about estimating a value function
or how to be able to predict rewards

also reinforcement learning methods interact with the environtment
where evolutionary methods do not

they are both in 'policy space' but learning a value function includes
the ability to use the information that occurs during different
individual moves in the game whereas evilutionary will treat all moves
in a game it won as equal


What does the temporal difference equation say in English?

Is the temporal difference equation kind of the analog of back propagation
in that it is the technique for calculating how much to change, but in
this case instead of the difference between the activations and the
target its the difference between the new state and the old state,
whatever 'state' means exactly I'm not sure but in the tic tac
toe example it was something like the probability of winning from
that position.





Formulate a question of your own about the reading.

there was talk of evolution and genetics in terms of machine learning
and I was wondering if there are machine leanring methods that
mate and produce offspring and what thats called
