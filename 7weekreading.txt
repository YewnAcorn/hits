Goals: Understand TD(0)

Tasks:

    Finish chapter 6 in Sutton and Barto (6.6 - 6.9 )
    Read Chapter 7 (7.1 - 7.5). 7.4 and 7.6 are optional.

    What is expected SARSA?

	Is it when SARSA is applied to state-action pairs rather than to states?

    What is n-step TD prediction?
	This is where instead of TD(0) where its based on the next reward, state, action
	its based on TD(n) so its looking ahead (or back) n number of moves


    Formulate a question of your own about the reading.
	is this all building towards some model that is best or does
	it end up being that there are lots of options depending on
	what the your needs are?
