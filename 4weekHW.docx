4 week HW 

worked with Quinn after class

exercise 4.1 
q(11,down) = 0  q(7,down) = -14

4.2
 v(15) = (v(12) + v(13) + v(14) + v(15) / 4)

4.3
 bellman equation

4.4
 add a condition that says going
 back and forth n times is a termination
 condition

4.5 how would policy iteration be defined for aciton values?
give a complete algortim for computing q*, analogous
to that on page 80 for computing v* This will be
used throughout the book

value[action] += nextState.reward * 0.9
for actions in actionSet:
	sum += values[action]
state.value = sum/actionSet.length

for n:
	greedyAction()
	exploratoryAction()
