> What is policy evaluation?
Part of what we were doing in lab 3 in the case where
the agent in gridworld could look at all the squares around the
one it was in and then calculate the value of its state based
on the discounted average of the values of the states around it

> What is policy improvement?
When instead of radomly exploring gridworld, the
agent makes greedy moves based on its estimates from the
previous step of policy evaluation

>What is policy iteration?
Policy iteration is combining the two pervious steps into
a 2-part loop of evaluating and then improving over and over
to converge to the actual values of each state

> What is value iteration?
It is just going through the policy iteration
one time.

So this is DP which needs a model which is the fact that
is keeping track of what values it considers each state
to have? Like it keeps its own grid of estimated state-values?

What makes it different than bellman? Or is it just applying bellman
as part of what its doing?
