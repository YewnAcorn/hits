gaussian

c exp(-x^2/2)
c exp(-(x-mean)^2/2 * sd ^2

sd = standard deviation, changes steepness of bump
mean controls x axis

sigmoid is the S shaped function

can be used in reinforcement learning
to cluster states in radial basis function

linnear means v(S, w)(x) = wT * x 
w transpose times x

in this case x is the values of the states ->
observed/estimated returns

x = G[t]
w = model

w describes the line 
for the linnear regression

y = mx + b 
w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 = 0

from separate states to continuous states?
we cant model the world completely so now
we can identify the state with the features
of the state. But with the ones that we can
observe we identify with a state.
so for this type of model the best we can
do is w is the state, x is the discounted return
modeling between states and actions, policies
reducing dimensionality, simple model. 

modeling the state with a fixed set of numbers
x = G[t](row,col)
v(S,w)(x) - G[t](x)

w is the coefficients
x are the features for each state we can measure the features

in a best fit line:

the points are the returns
the line is the value function
the weights move the line to minimize the error

TD lambda is the gold standard in reinforcement learning
