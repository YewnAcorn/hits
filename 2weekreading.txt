1. What is the differenc between associative and non-associative
settings?

associative is when there are different situations that
can be faced but in a non-associative problem there is only one
situation. This is a simplified problem so we can learn basic
learning methods to apply later to the full problem.

How does the book define the value of an action?

The value is the expected reward for a given action,
there is also the actual value that is unknown but
is trying to get estimated by this equation

true (actual) value of action a = q(a)
estimated value on tth time step as Q[t](a) 

the true value is the mean reward when that action
is selected. this is estimated by averaging the 
rewards after selecting that action. 
on the tth time step action a has been chosen N[t](a) times so far
(not including t) 
with rewards R[0], R[1]...R[N[t](a)v],
then the estimated value is

Q[t](a) = (R[0], R[1]...R[N[t](a)v]) / N[t](a)

so thats all the rewards that this move has accumulated
so far divided by the number of times the move has been made
is the estimated value


What is epsilon-greedy?
Almost always choosing greedy but every now and then
choosing ramdomly to explore

in the example it gets tested on 2000 randomly generated
10-arm bandits. each arm has a different value and its
this methods job to find the right one. It tests pure
greedy vs. epsilon = 0.1 vs. epsilon = 0.01

in the graph it shows episolon = 0.1 finds the optimum faster
but can never choose it more than %91 of the time. the episolon = 0.01
method finds the optimum slower but eventually performs better

epsolon can be lowered over time to get the best of both


What is the difference between a stationary and a non-stationary setting?
the values that are getting estimated in stationary are static 
but in non-stationary the actual value can change over time
reinforcing the need for exploration. It is common in RL 
to deal with non-stationary cases


Formulate a question of your own about the reading.
I got lost on equation 2.3 where its showing how to
calculate the reward
