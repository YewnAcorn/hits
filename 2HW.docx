Answer questions embedded in Chapter 2: 

2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8

Some of the questions are open-ended, so write what you can, and upload your file as docx or pdf.


Exercise 2.1 In " -greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and " = 0 . 5, what is
the probability that the greedy action is selected? 

50% probability


Exercise 2.3 In the comparison shown in Figure 2.2, which method will perform best in
the long run in terms of cumulative reward and probability of selecting the best action?
How much better will it be? Express your answer quantitatively.


epsilon = 0.01 will perform best in the long run
it will eventually choose the best action 99% of the time
compared to epsilon 0.1 starts out better but will plateau
at choosing the right action 90% of the time


Exercise 2.6: Mysterious Spikes The results shown in Figure 2.3 should be quite reliable
because they are averages over 2000 individual, randomly chosen 10-armed bandit tasks.
Why, then, are there oscillations and spikes in the early part of the curve for the optimistic
method? In other words, what might make this method perform particularly better or
worse, on average, on particular early steps? 

if it just gets lucky and happens to land on the right one
early on
