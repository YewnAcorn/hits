    Read chapter 5 in Sutton and Barto (5.1 - 5.4 )

    What does exploring starts mean?
It means starting with a state-action pair and having
a probability of starting with any state-action pair so
that after starting enough times, each state-action pair
will be explored at least once. This is done to deal with
the fact that without this, the policy is not guaranteed
to check every state-action pair

    What are off-policy methods?

off-policy methods are one of the ways to ensure
that all state-action pairs are explored without
using exploring starts. 

    Describe epsilon-soft in English.
The likelihood of making an exploratory move

    Formulate a question of your own about the reading.
Not really sure what to make of the equations of epilon soft.
Is it saying take the value of epsilon divided by the number of
possible actions in that state? And what does that do? What is that
number for?
