PDC - Reading Week 6 Systems

1. spatial locality is when something is physically close like how the
	registers on the main chip are physically closer than something in an external
	hard drive
2. Row-maor order is more efficient. Its like if you were getting books at the library
	row-major would be finishing one book before checking out another
	where column-major would be reading only the first chapter of a booke
	before going back to the library, and reading the first chapter of every
	book you inteneded to read, before going back to the first book and reading
	the second chapter. This causes a much higher number of trips to the library
3. L1 is the smallest and fastest cache, followed by L2 which is a bit slower and bigger

4. yes

5. measures cache performance


6. is this something that only comes up in certain fields? What are those fields?
