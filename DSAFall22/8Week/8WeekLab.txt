Turning in late, so again not remembering who I worked with
We got the hellothreads.c and scalarmultiply.c from the book
and tinkered around with them. Hellothreads was cool to see
threads for the first time and scalarmultiply using an id
to break the job into chunks is pretty mind blowing. Feel like
I'm finally starting to get to the level where I can get a sense
for how things are really done on computers in the real world.
maybe? Question is, I can see my computer has 2 physical cores and
has 2 hypertheads per core, so really 4 cores, but at any given time
it seems like cores 0 and 2 are running most of the work and cores
1 and 4 are picking up the slack, is there a specific reason for that
or is it just how things happen to play out ends up that way?
