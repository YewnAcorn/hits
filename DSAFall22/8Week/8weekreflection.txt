This week I learned the beginnings of how to use threads to run a process in parallel
on multiple cores. Normally having multiple cores lets more processes get done faster
but running theads within a process can allow that single process to run faster. This
was really challenging to understand at first since it is complex and has unfamilliar
syntax and heady ideas. Just wrapping my mind arond the concept took so much effort
so I had to read these chapters a couple times before I could finally start to get
the picture. I'll probably want to go over them again in the future. I'm glad I got
a physical copy of the book it makes reading certain parts easier and then the eBook
is free and useful for the parts with code. My question for this week is to understand
the differences and similarities between mutithreading and the node.js asynchronous
callback system
