Week 7 Reflection

Carter Gunderson

This week we learned about C and how to use a makefile and how to link files
together. We also worked on learning how to make a recursive tree using
preorder and post order. This week I also got the first prototype of my
group project to work. So now the program goes through the entire process
at least at a rudimentary level, which is pretty satisfying, but there is
still more to do.
