1. I am turning this in late, I did it in class with a group
	but now I cant remember exactly who, some of the cast
	of folks in zoomland

2. got valgrind running on the linux on my raspberry pi
	to run cachegrind, callgrind, massif

3. My guess for big O is n**2

4.running valgrind stuff was fun to do on game of life
	I forgot that I had programmed it to run in an infinite loop
	So when I put it into massif the first time it just started
	the game of life again with the massif ID stuff thrown in there
	made me laugh, like the experiment was breaking out of the
	petri dish
