this week we learned about callgrind, cachegrind and massif
I had to do it on my raspberry pi which was fun to do
stuff like that, because its remote, but also local
Saw how callgrind breaks down each line and function call
to show how many times it runs each line
I was surprised to see how much is really going on
numbers in the billions. Computers are so fast!
I cant believe a physical machine can move that fast.
