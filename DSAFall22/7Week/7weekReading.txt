Questions

1. What information does callgrind provide?
	It provides the number of instrucitons per line of code
	and the number of times a particular function was run

2. What is function inlining?
	It puts the code from the function into main so that the
	instructions associated with calling and returning a function
	can be skipped. It looks like a disadvantage would be, if you
	manually write the code with a inline function, the code will
	be less readable and harder to change later on.

3. What is loop unrolling?
	loop unrolling is an optimization technique used by the compiler
	it can make a loop do calcualtions in larger numbers before iterating
	again. In this way it can avoid having to check against the loop's
	conditions as many times or calculate those variables in the loop's
	conditions. It is something the compiler does. Not something to do
	manually

4. Other questions
	Is the C language used on pretty much every machine? It seems ubiquitous
	Is gcc the compiler of choice or is it just the best one to learn on?
