PDC - Reading Week 9 Systems

1. What is false sharing for the cache?
	False sharing is when multiple threads are trying to use the same
	cacheline which bogs things down, because if you modify one cache
	line then the other copies are going to be invalidated, so instead
	of speeding things up, having false sharing slows things down

2. What is a mutex lock and when would you use it? Give an example.
	a mutex lock is a way to make sure that part of a program runs
	exclusively and is not done in parallel. It is good for the part
	of a thread that updates shared/global variables

3. What is #pragma omp for?
	its a way to get threads to do part of a for loop like we were doing
	in these labs, but it is easier it looks like

4. Questions:
	When I tried to compile in gcc in openmp on my mac with the 
	command: 
	
	$ gcc -o hello_mp hello_mp.c -fopenmp
	
	then I would get this error:

	clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'

	So I looked it up and it looks like I gotta do a bunch of
	computer stuff to make it work, I'll try that now.
	But maybe it just doesn't work on mac like valgind dont
	but thats what I have raspberry pi and docker for I guess.
