I worked with Ahman and Dominic and Mika
We worked in class on the gitpod workspace
we worked on getting the theads to work and
getting gdb to show us the inner workings of
when threads are created

Good to remember how to do commandline arguments in gdb
and interesting to see that it looks likethe main thread 
is recycled to be used as one of the parallel threads
because only n-1 threads are created for
    #pragma omp parallel num_threads(n)
