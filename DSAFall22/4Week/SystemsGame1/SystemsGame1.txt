1. the value of *ptr2 (as in the dereferenced pointer)
	will be the value of ptr1 which is &y which is
	7

2. (a) because the ts[10] already does the dereferencing
	where the -> operator does the deref/assignment
	in one, so it would be too much with the [10] part

3. in the heap

4. its only a pointer that is going to be pointing to memory
	that obstensibly is already allocated for board1 and board2

5. (void *) is the type of pointer returned by malloc()
	its a type of pointer that is not associated with
	a specific type of data. As opposed to (char *) or
	(int *)
