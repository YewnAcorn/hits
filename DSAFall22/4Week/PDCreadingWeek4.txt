PDC- Reading Week4 Systems

1. shouldn't it be malloc(sizeof(short) * r * c)
 or something like that

2. break main

3. run <command line arguments>

4. goes to next line but treats a whole function call
	as a line.

5. print val

6. x <memory address expression>

7. print $register

8. info about memory errors, trying to read or write to
	uninitialized memory or freeing already free memory
	or memory leaks, (allocated memory that nothing points to)

9. it looks like two registers can be referenced in an instruction
	one source and one destination

10. pushes a copy of s to the top of the stack

11. the base pointer or rbp is related to rsp. the book says the base pointer isnt used as much 
	anymore but in earlier systems it helped keep track of the base of the active stack frame

12. if rbp isnt used for what it used to be for what is it used for?
