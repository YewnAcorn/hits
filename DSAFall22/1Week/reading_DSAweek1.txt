    Will the string "hello" fit in an array char[5]? Explain.

    	The string will techinically fit but it should realy have one extra space for the ‘\0’
	terminating character.

    Will the following code fragment generate a compiler error?

    int array[20];
    array[20] = 1;

		No it wont it will write 1 to whatever is in that memory location and it could
		mess things up that way.

    If a function takes an array as a parameter, how does it know the size of the array?

		You have to enter the size as another parameter.

    What is the risk of using strcpy()?
	
	strcpy() takes for granted a lot of things like the presence of termination characters
	and the size of the strings being appropriate. So if user input was the string being copied
	it could be way too long and overwrite whatever memory it comes in contact with.
