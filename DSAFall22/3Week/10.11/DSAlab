1. Big-O For Loop

int product(int a, int b)
{
     int sum = 0;
     for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
             sum += a;
     }
     return sum;
}
 
I think this one is O(b)

2 Big-O While Loop

int sumDigits(int n)
{
       int sum = 0;
       while (n > 0) {
                   sum += n % 10;
                   n /= 10;
       }
       return sum;
}

This one should be O(log n) because the algorithm doesn't even do it n times

3. Palindrome Permutation

I'm thinking this one is O(n!) because it has to try a letter for every possible position
other than the position it already is

4. One Away

is this one O(n)? because it only has to check each character once, so it will only
take as long as the length n of the input?
