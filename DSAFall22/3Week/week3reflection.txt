This week we studied big O. I thought it was interesting because it used math.
we learned some things from microsoft interviews and other companies.
I didn't always know how to make the most efficient algorithm. We also learned
about the game of life which I really liked. Stuff like that is what I like
about computers. Some weird math thing that does something cool and makes
you think about life a little bit. Neat. 
It made me think: that since a new cell being born is, in the game of life, 
a dead cell coming back from the dead, then is being born in a sense coming
back from the dead? I thought about it and it kind of is, right? "Before I was
born I was dead." makes sense. But then "when I die I will be dead, which is
something I've been before *and gotten out of before.*" that is new, to me
I mean it makes sense, but its not how I thought about it before. Cool. Thanks
