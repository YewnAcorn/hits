PDC - Lab Week5
Carter Gunderson

This one I worked alone. I made a program in C that was
simple and disassembled it and read the file put by objdump -d
to see assembly stuff. Then I installed docker and did the same
thing in a linux environment. Pretty cool. I'm amazed how fast
it could just spin up a whole linux environment inside my mac.
I have questions about docker, but its like all the questions,
so I think I'll just watch some tutorials and get to know the app
so I can have more relevant questions. Code is on github
