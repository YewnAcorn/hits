PDC - Reading Week 5 Systems

1. a stack frame is a unit of data that gets pushed to the stack for a function

2. %rbp is the base pointer, aka the frame pointer, points the the base of the
	current stack frame
3. %rsp is the stack pointer, always points to the top of the tack

4. %rip is the instruction pointer, keeps track of which instruction 
	comes next, points to an address in code segment memory (not stack)
5. %rdi

6. you subtract 4 because the stack grows by going down and 4 is 
	the size of an integer in memory

7. why doesn't C have a way to express binary?
