this week we studied more assembly language how to use different commands to 
examine an assembly file and about the structure of memory. I learned
about the registers and it seems like its a whole nother language so
it'll take some time to learn it to be fluent. Just picking my way through
the particulars here and there. It would be cool if there was some visualization
of how all the registers work. Maybe someone made one already I'll look into
it.
