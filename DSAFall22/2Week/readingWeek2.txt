The Mythical Man-Month

I read "The Programming Systems Product." It was about how much
actually goes in to making a finished programming product. It's
not as easy as making a little doodad in an IDE that reverses a
string or something like that. The projects have to fit together
and have documentation, standardization and testing. This takes time
and we shouldn't be over-optimistic in our scheduling practices.

I read the "Joys of the Craft" and the "Woes of the Craft." I really liked the
first one. It was about how programming is magical. I was happy to see someone
put it into words that way. I feel the same sometimes. I personally got hooked
on programming after being a little curious about it. Before computers I was
getting my techincal kicks working on my motorcycles and my friends' vehicles.
I needed something in my life that was run by reality and mechanic fiddling
was satisfying for me in that way. Once I discovered coding I realized it was
satisfying in the same way, but I was able to get that satisfaction more
frequently, and with less physical exertion and trips to the hardware store.

As far as the woes of the craft, I anticipate the corporate environment to
be less than enlightened in many ways. Maybe I'll just hunker down in academia.
The business world seems insane honestly. Maybe I'll try it just to see, but
I'll probably just end up trying to work for some educational nonprofit or something.
