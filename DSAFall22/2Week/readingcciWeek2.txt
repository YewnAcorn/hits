Reading for CCI
week 2

Chapter I: The interview process

This chapter describes the interview process. It basically confirmed my expectations
The interviewer asks the interviewee to "whiteboard" some problem that tests 
their knowledge of coding. It reminds me of this guy who was some kind of 
airspace engineer. His interview was that he was given a "basket case," a box
of parts all mixed up and told it was an airplane and that it needed to fly.
So it makes sense to me that for an engineering job you have to demonstrate 
that you have a certain level of proficency in some weird scenario.


Chapter II: Behind the scenes

This chapter talks about the specifcs of interviewing at the biggest tech companies. Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, etc.
They have different hiring methods. Like some places you apply to work there in genereal like at facebook. But at Palanir and
others you apply to work for a specific team. Microsoft wants you to be "passionate about techonology" whereas Apple wants you
to be "passionate about Apple." I thought that was funny because even Microsoft knows that no one is "passionate about Microsoft"
Honestly I think I would prefer not to work for any of these companies. If I had to pick maybe I'd say Apple because they
seem like they have the least amount of evil in their reputation. But I'd prefer none of the above. Instead I would like
to work for open-souce projects or non-profits or random weird start ups or teach.
