Goals: Understand TD(0)
Read section 5.5 (skip the equations) and 5.7
Read chapter 6 in Sutton and Barto (6.1 - 6.5 )

What does temporal difference mean in this context?

it is a way of combining monte carlo and dynamic programming
this is what we did for k-armed bandits though, wasn't it?
Was that just to prepare us for this? Is it the same?

What is SARSA?

an algorithm for doing on-policy TD learning
it goes: State Action Reward State Action


What is Q-learning?

it sounds like its kind of like SARSA but its
off-policy. Does that mean it has to be more
like dynamic programming in that it has to
look at all the potential moves from a state?
Does it need a model then?


Questions:

This sentence right here is how the book introduces
importance samplingi in 5.5: 

"Importance sampling is a general technique for estimating expected values
under one distribution given samples from another."

I cant figure out what that means
